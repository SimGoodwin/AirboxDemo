# AirboxDemo

Develop a streamlined mobile application for Airbox Systems that facilitates the viewing of photographs. The images are categorised into three distinct groups: Cars, Helicopters, and Boats.
Functional Requirements:
1. The application must feature three interactive buttons, each corresponding to one of the photo categories: Cars, Helicopters, and Boats.
2. Upon selection of a category, the app shall display up to nine images from the respective folder in a dynamic layout that adapts to the quantity of images available.
3. Users must be able to tap on an image to view it in full-screen mode, with an option to return to the main view.
4. The application should be developed using .NET MAUI, with cross-platform functionality targeting Android, iOS, and optionally UWP (Universal Windows Platform).
   
Assessment Criteria:<br/>
● Code Quality: Emphasis will be placed on the clarity, maintainability, and readability of the code.<br/>
● Architecture: Effective use of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to ensure a clean separation between business logic and user interface.<br/>
● Enhancements (Optional): Incorporation of animations, XAML storyboards, or UWP visual layer animations to enhance user experience.<br/>

Recommended Technologies and Practices:<br/>
● Utilisation of modern development tools and practices such as dependency injection, unit testing, and asynchronous programming.<br/>
● Implementation of CI/CD pipelines for automated building and testing (optional).<br/>

Deliverables:<br/>
● A Visual Studio, Rider or VS Code solution containing the complete application codebase.<br/>
● Comprehensive documentation outlining the high-level architecture, along with commentary on the approach taken to address the problem.<br/>
● Any additional scripts or configuration files necessary to build and run the application.<br/>

Submission Guidelines:<br/>
Please package your deliverables in a clean, organised manner, and submit them through a public GitHub repository. <br/>
Ensure that the documentation is accessible and provides sufficient guidance for understanding the application's structure and build process.<br/>
